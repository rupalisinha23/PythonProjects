The fact that a glowing coal appears as a line of light when it is moved around quickly has been used to illustrate the idea of persistence of vision. It is known as the "sparkler's trail effect", named after the trail that appears when a sparkler is moved around quickly.
The effect has been applied in the arts by writing or drawing with a light source recorded by a camera with a long exposure time.
