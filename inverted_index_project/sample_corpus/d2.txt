Persistence of vision traditionally refers to the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye. The illusion has also been described as "retinal persistence"persistence of impressions",simply "persistence" and other variations. According to this definition, the illusion would be the same as, or very similar to positive afterimages.
"Persistence of vision" can also be understood to mean the same as "flicker fusion",the effect that vision seems to persist when a stream of light is repeatedly interrupted for very brief instances and can't really enter the eyes continuously.
Since its introduction, the term "persistence of vision" has been believed to be the explanation for motion perception in optical toys like the phenakistiscope and the zoetrope, and later in cinema. However, this theory has been disputed even before cinema was introduced in 1895. If "persistence of vision" is explained as "flicker fusion", it can be seen as an important factor in the illusion of moving pictures in cinema and related optical toys. In the stroboscopic effect of the thaumatrope the vision of one image seems to persist, despite the fact that actually two different parts of the image are presented alternately with very short interruptions in between. In film the vision of a moving or changing image seems to persist, despite the fact that a sequence of different images is presented with interruptions in between.
Early descriptions of the illusion often attributed the effect purely to imperfections of the eye, particularly of the retina. Nerves and parts of the brain later became part of explanations.
