# Inverted Index

This project reads .txt files from the corpus directory and creates an inverted index. It then searches for the user provided words and retrieves the documents. For more information on inverted index, please refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index.


## Getting Started

Run the project using: python inverted_index.py /path-of-corpus directory
